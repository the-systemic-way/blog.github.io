            <p>This blog is my holding space that allows me to share, express, reflect and connect deeper within and with you. It is an exercise in contemplation, reflection and a mindful relaxation of learnings and experiences that evolve as I deepen my relationship with the systemic work and thinking deeply inspired by the work of Systemic Constellations or Family Constellations by Bert Hellinger in Germany and my trainer,master in India.  </p>

<h2 id="howitallbegan">How it all began</h2>

<p>In January 2014 I was going through a tough time interpersonally at cross roads again between myself and my family and I was seeking strength to face the unknown, a virtue that seemed disappearing from within gripped with anxiety and a haziness that was so distinguishable and yet alien. It was emotional turmoil gripped with a deep fear and a strong sense of disconnect with myself in my body as well as my relationship with my family. </p>

<p>On a fine morning I walked blindly into a Family Constellation Workshop by Annie Cariappa and sooner that I thought I was in the client's chair pouring my heart with words that kept betraying my lips. <br>
I walked into the unknown with a trust and uncertainty that I had never felt before. In the coming months what unfolded in that constellation was determined to stay with me forever and I continued on the journey of systemic living, experiencing, expressing, learning and sharing.</p>

<h2 id="whereiamnow">Where I am now</h2>

<p>I am at a junction where I seek the blessings and wisdom of my ancestors from whom I come with all my values, strength, virtues, flaws and all of my inheritance. To whom I belong and from whom I seek the wisdom of living and learning. I bow to all my many gurus, masters that touched my lives and shaped in one way or another. I see how my life experiences enriched and exposed those wounds of my soul I am grateful to these life experiences. I carry within me the various learnings, skills that I gained, learned, picked along this journey of life, I traversed many paths and donned many roles and all that it makes me who I am today. Soaked in this wealth I step ahead and look at my future in my full potential as a women as I am exactly as I am.</p>

<h2 id="thejourneyahead">The journey ahead</h2>

<p>The culmination of these experiences call me towards a exploring and engaging with the complexities and depths of interpersonal relationships, interdependent living, co-creation with an inbuilt harmony of the natural world. </p>
